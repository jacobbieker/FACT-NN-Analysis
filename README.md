# Using Deep Learning for FACT Source Detection
This project was originally used for the thesis requirement for the Robert D. Clark Honors College, Department of Physics, and Department of Computer Science at the University of Oregon.

This project focuses on using convolutional neural networks to perform analysis of air shower events for the First G-APD Cherenkov Telescope (FACT), located in the Canary Islands.
